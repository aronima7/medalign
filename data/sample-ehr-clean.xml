                Emergency Department Provider Note Name: Jessica Jones, MD MRN: [1234555] ED Arrival: 10/08/2018 Room #: 17B History and Physical Triage: 52 year old woman with unknown past medical history presenting with right sided weakness since about 2 hours ago. Last known normal 5:45pm. She said she was feeling well and then suddenly noticed that her right arm and leg went limp. She denies taking any blood thinners, and has had no recent surgeries. NIHSS currently graded at an 8: 4 no movement in R arm and 4 no movement in R leg CT head is negative for any bleed or any early ischemic changes. INR is 1.0, Plt 133. Discussed with patient the severity of symptoms and the concern that they are caused by a stroke, and that IV tPA is the best medication to reduce the risk of long term deficits. Patient is agreeable and IV tPA was given at 8:20pm. Initially SBP 210/100, labetalol 5mg IV x1 given and came down to 180/90. IV tPA given after this point. Patient will need to be admitted to the ICU, with close neurological monitoring. Plan for head CT 24 hours post IV tPA administration, stroke workup including LDL, HA1C, echo, tele monitoring. Local neurology consult in AM.

                Inpatient Rehabilitation Provider Note Name: Annika Patel, MD MRN: [1234555] Arrival: 10/20/2018 Room #: 40 History and Physical Triage: 52 yo F with newly dxâ€™d HTN, DM, HL admitted to rehab post small vessel ischemic stroke. She is progressing well in this past week with daily physical therapy. Strength has since improved objectively since her initial presentation to the ER: NIHSS initially was 8 and now it is at a 4 (weakness in the right arm and right leg). BP currently 180/90 Patient did complain of a new severe headache on the left side today post therapy, currently takes aspirin 81mg daily. Plan for CT head today to rule out any intracerebral hemorrhage post ischemic stroke, as well as labetalol 5mg IV x 1 for elevated blood pressure. If CT scan looks unrevealing, then plan for one more week of physical therapy and then likely discharge to home with home PT.

Patient was hospitalized last month for new left sided hemifield loss. Was out of the window for IV tPA, no large vessel occlusion seen, and found to have new ischemic infarcts, most notably in the R occipital lobe. Afib was seen on telemetry. She had been on aspirin 81mg at home but subsequently was switched to eliquis for stroke prevention given the afib. She has had no issues with eliquis so far. Exam significant for L sided hemianopsia currently, and minimal weakness in the right and left leg, 5-/5 strength 
                MRI Brain 4/28/22: Diffuse acute-subacute ischemic infarcts, in right occipital lobe, left temporal lobe, left frontal lobe, largest in the R occipital lobe. 
                Plan to continue eliquis, follow up with primary care physician.
