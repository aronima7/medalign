MedAlign is a clinician-generated dataset for instruction following with electronic medical records.

The MedAlign dataset contains:
- <b>1314 clinician-generated instructions</b>, 983 after removing duplicates using ROUGE-L overlap;
- <b>276 longitudinal EHRs</b>;
- <b>303 clinician-generated responses</b> to instruction-EHR pairs.

All these assets will be shared in coming months, under a standard research DUA.
