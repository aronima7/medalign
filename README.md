# MedAlign

MedAlign is a clinician-generated dataset for instruction following with electronic medical records.

The MedAlign dataset contains:
- <b>1314 clinician-generated instructions</b>, 983 after removing duplicates using ROUGE-L overlap;
- <b>276 longitudinal EHRs</b>;
- <b>303 clinician-generated responses</b> to instruction-EHR pairs.

All data assets will be shared in coming months, under a standard research license and data use agreement (similar to the PhysioNet Credentialed Health [Data License](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/view-license/2.2/) and [Data Use Agreement](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/view-dua/2.2/), which require users to undergo [CITI training](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/view-required-training/2.2/) prior to access).
